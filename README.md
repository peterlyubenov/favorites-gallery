# Album Browser

Album Browser is a web application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. It fetches albums and photos from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and allows users to browse them, as well as pick favorite photos. The app uses Redux and Redux Persist to store user favorites in local storage, and React Router DOM for navigation. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
